#Defects#
##as of 1.0.0 initial commit##


==========================================



###autoPlay###

`settings.autoPlay`

when setting autoPlay to `false` you lose the ability to have buttons, and the choice about having 
those buttons be links or not



###slideShowSpeed###

If the slideshow is not set to autoPlay, the rule establishing a 1000 millisecond bottom limit 
in the code is violated.
